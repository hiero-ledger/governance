# GitHub App Installation Guidelines

Installing GitHub Apps allows automation and integration, but they can potentially be a security risk since each app can access parts of your repositories and organization data.
Follow these steps to ensure you install apps securely and intentionally.

## Research Your App's Legitimacy

- Make sure the app belongs to a trusted publisher.
- Read reviews in GitHub Marketplace if available and review other sources of feedback.
- Inspect the permissions required as well as potential costs.
- Review if there is any other similar app already installed in your organization and available for your repos.

## Validate Functionality

- Consider creating a fork for testing purposes to verify app functionality.
- Avoid requesting apps that may conflict with existing apps.
- After approval and installation, continue to review app behavior and report any unexpected behavior.

## Scope the App's needs

- Scope and limit the repos in your organization that need the app.
- Ensure the permissions required for the app to function align with your organization's guidelines.
- If the app requires a bot account, make sure to consult first with the LFDT/staff team.
- If this is a short term need, make sure to assign a point of contact responsible of requesting its deletion.

## Submit Your Request for Installation

- Start a new discussion in your organization using the "App Requests" template or using [this link](https://github.com/orgs/hiero-ledger/discussions/new?category=app-requests).
  1. Provide the exact/full name of the app.
  2. Specify the repos in which the app is needed. (Preferably scope it to the minimum possible).
  3. Provide a justification, motive, or need that the app will solve. Identify any potential costs, permissions questions, unresolved concerns. Be sure to include the duration this app is needed (long-term or a short-term install).
  4. Optionally, include any teams that need to review this request.
