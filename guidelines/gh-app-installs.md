# GitHub App Installation Guidelines

Installing GitHub Apps allows automation and integration, but they can potentially be a security risk since each app can access parts of your repositories and organization data.
Follow these steps to ensure you install apps securely and intentionally.

## Reaserch Your App's Legitimacy

- Make sure the app belongs to a trusted publisher.
- Read reviews in GitHub Marketplace if available or do a short reaserch.
- Inspect the permissions required as well as potential costs.
- Review if there is any other similar app already installed in your organization and available for your repos.

## Validate Functionality

- Ensure that the app works as intended (in your test fork).
- Avoid requesting apps that could potentially cause conflict with already existing apps.
- After installation (and if approved) make sure to monitor and report any strange behaviour.

## Scope the App's needs

- Scope and limit the repos in your organization that need the app.
- Ensure that the permissions required for the app to function align with your organization's guidelines.
- If the app requires the need or a bot account, make sure to consult first with the LFDT/staff team.
- If this is a short term need, make sure to assign a point of contact responsible of requesting it's deletion.

## Submit Your Request for Installation

- Start a new discussion in your organization using the "App Requests" template or using [this link](https://github.com/orgs/hiero-ledger/discussions/new?category=app-requests).
1. Provide the exact/full name of the app.
2. Specify the repos in which the app is needed. (Preferably scope it to the minimum possible).
3. Provide a justification, motive or need that the app will solve.
4. Optionally, include any teams that need to review this request.
