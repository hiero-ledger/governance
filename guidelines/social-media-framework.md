# **Hiero Social Media Guidelines Framework**

**For creating your own social media guidelines**

These guidelines are designed to help new Hiero-affiliated accounts (e.g., working groups, community chapters, technical subprojects) create their own tailored social media standards while maintaining brand and governance alignment with **LF Decentralized Trust (LFDT)**.

---

## **1\. Purpose and Alignment**

Every Hiero social media account exists to:

* Share open source progress, releases, and ecosystem updates.

* Celebrate community and contributor milestones.

* Foster trust, collaboration, and transparency.

* Represent Hiero neutrally — **not** any single vendor or company.

**Include in your local guidelines:**  
 A short “Purpose” statement explaining how your account supports the above goals (e.g., sharing developer updates, showcasing integration pilots, etc.).

---

## **2\. Branding and Attribution**

Always identify as part of the ecosystem:

**“Hiero, an LF Decentralized Trust project.”**

* Do not use proprietary or company branding (e.g., “Hedera’s Hiero”).

* Use approved logos, color palette, and naming from LFDT media kit.

* Link to: [www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org)

**Include in your local guidelines:**  
 Your account bio and description template, ensuring alignment with the above format.

---

## **3\. Tone and Voice**

The voice of Hiero is:

* **Inspiring but grounded** — highlight impact without exaggeration.

* **Neutral and inclusive** — represent all contributors equally.

* **Technically clear** — explain concepts simply and accurately.

Avoid:

* Marketing language or hyperbole.

* Endorsements of specific vendors, tokens, or platforms.

* Personal opinions expressed as project statements.

**Include in your local guidelines:**  
 Examples of “Do” and “Don’t” posts to guide your moderators.

---

## **4\. Content Focus**

Your posts should primarily focus on:

* Open source milestones (releases, new contributors, integrations).

* Technical updates (SDKs, JSON-RPC, mirror nodes, identity tools).

* Governance and community events.

* Educational resources and explainers.

Avoid:

* Token or investment content.

* Speculation, price discussions, or non-open-source promotions.

**Include in your local guidelines:**  
 A 70/20/10 rule:

* 70% informative/educational

* 20% community/recognition

* 10% event or announcement promotion

---

## **5\. Engagement and Moderation**

* Respond respectfully and factually to all community inquiries.

* Avoid debates or defensive replies.

* Escalate sensitive or misinformed posts internally.

* Use inclusive language and accessible visuals.

**Include in your local guidelines:**

* A process for responding to questions or misinformation.

* A short escalation checklist (e.g., flag to project comms lead).

---

## **6\. Approval and Oversight**

* Drafts for official statements or sensitive announcements must be reviewed by:

  * **pr@lfdecentralizedtrust.org**

  * Or your Hiero project comms lead.

* Trademark-sensitive content must be cleared through:

  * **trademark@lfdecentralizedtrust.org**

**Include in your local guidelines:**

* Who approves posts before publishing.

* A cadence for review (weekly, biweekly).

---

## **7\. Accessibility and Localization**

* Include alt text for images.

* Use high-contrast visuals.

* When possible, translate key updates into other community languages.

**Include in your local guidelines:**

* Standards for accessibility.

* Language or localization policy (if applicable).

---

## **8\. Compliance and Recordkeeping**

* Follow LFDT privacy, moderation, and community guidelines.

* Keep post archives and moderation logs for at least 6 months.

* Report any brand misuse or impersonation accounts.
