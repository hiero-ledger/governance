# üê£ Good First Issue Guidelines

This guide explains what qualifies as a ‚ÄúGood First Issue‚Äù and how to create one for new contributors.
All our good first issues are labeled with the `good first issue` label.
An overview of all open good first issues can be found [here](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Ahiero-ledger+archived%3Afalse+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+).

## What is a Good First Issue?

A Good First Issue is a task that is suitable for newcomers to the project. It should be:

- **Well-defined**: The issue should have a clear goal and scope.
- **Manageable**: The task should be small enough to be completed in a reasonable amount of time (typically a few hours).
- **Educational**: The issue should help the newcomer learn about the project and its codebase.
- **Non-critical**: The issue should not involve critical functionality or complex dependencies.
- **Documented**: The issue should include all necessary information, such as links to relevant documentation, code examples, and any prerequisites.

Examples of Good First Issues:

- Documentation updates (typos, broken links, clarifying setup steps).
- Adding or improving tests for small, isolated components.
- Code style or linting improvements.
- Simple bug fixes with clear reproduction steps.
- Small feature enhancements (e.g., adding a config flag, improving log messages).

## üìã Step by step guide to do a contribution

If you have never contributed to an open source project at GitHub, the following step-by-step guide will introduce you to the workflow.
More information and concrete samples for shell commands for each step can be found in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
A more detailed general documentation of the GitHub PR workflow can be found [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md).

- [ ] **Claim this issue:** Comment below that you are interested in working on the issue
- [ ] **Wait for assignment:** A community member with the given rights will add you as an assignee of the issue
- [ ] **Work on the issue:** Follow the detailed description in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
- [ ] **You did it üéâ:** We will merge the fix in the main branch. Thanks for being part of the Hiero community as an open-source contributor ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üéâ Contribute to Hacktoberfest

At the time of the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) event we try to mark all PRs that solve any good first issue with the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.
If you want to resolve this issue as part of Hacktoberfest and we missed adding the label, simply add a comment to the issue or PR, and we will add it.

## ü§î Additional Information

If you have any questions about the topic of this issue, please ask us directly by adding a comment below.
Additionally, we invite you to join our community on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kEnnmB9A) server or attend our [public community calls](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/hiero?view=week).

A general manual about open-source contributions can be found [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md).
```

Once you created the issue, please make sure to add the `good first issue candidate` label to it.
Please do not add the `good first issue` label directly, as we want to review all issues before adding that label.

## Reviewing Good First Issues Candidates

All candidates for good first issues can be found [here](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20org%3Ahiero-ledger%20archived%3Afalse%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%20candidate%22).

The review process for good first issues candidates is as follows:

1. **Verify Issue Completeness:** Ensure the issue contains a clear description, expected outcome, relevant links, and any necessary context or prerequisites.
2. **Check Scope and Complexity:** Confirm that the issue is well-defined, manageable, educational, non-critical, and documented, as outlined above.
3. **Assess Suitability for Newcomers:** Make sure the issue does not require deep project knowledge or access to sensitive resources.
4. **Provide Feedback:** If the issue is missing information or does not meet the criteria, leave a comment with suggestions for improvement.
5. **Label Appropriately:** Once the issue meets all requirements, remove the `good first issue candidate` label and add the `good first issue` label.
6. **Encourage Discussion:** Invite the original author and other contributors to ask questions or clarify details as needed.

By following these steps, maintainers help ensure that good first issues are welcoming and accessible to new contributors.

## Reviewing Pull Requests based on Good First Issues

Please follow these tips when reviewing a PR based on a Good First Issues label:

- **Be welcoming and constructive** ‚Äì remember many contributors are making their very first PR. Encourage, don‚Äôt discourage.
- **Check for clarity** ‚Äì if something is missing in the PR (tests, docs, formatting), explain why it matters and guide the contributor.
- **Keep scope small** ‚Äì if the PR goes beyond the intended ‚Äúgood first issue,‚Äù help contributors refocus rather than rejecting outright.
- **Celebrate success** ‚Äì acknowledge even small improvements; positive feedback keeps new contributors engaged.

If the Pull Request is created as part of Hacktoberfest (https://hacktoberfest.com) the "hacktoberfest-accepted" label should be added to the PR when it is merged.
This ensures the contribution is counted toward the contributor‚Äôs Hacktoberfest progress. 
Progress may help them earn some cool rewards for their efforts.
