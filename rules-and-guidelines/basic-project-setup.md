# Basic Project Setup

In Hiero we have defined a basic / minimal setup for projects regarding best practices and security.
Every project in Hiero mus fullfill those guidelines and the project state regarding those guidelines will be checked frequently.
This document gives an overview of the needed minmal project setup and describe why we chosen those configurations and security tools.

## Common Project Structure 

The LFDT TAC defines a common repository structure including required files per repository.
Since Hiero is part of LFDT we must follow those guidelines.
The documentation can be found [here](https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/repository-structure/).
