# Repo Rules Exceptions for hiero-ledger projects

This document serves as a record of project-specific exceptions to the [Hiero Ledger Roles and Groups document](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/governance/blob/main/roles-and-groups.md). These governance rules are designed to ensure consistent and collaborative project management across the hiero-ledger GitHub organization. However, exceptions may be proposed when specific project needs warrant deviation from the standard roles and group structures.

Project Maintainers and Committers are authorized to request exceptions and must obtain approval from the Maintainers group before implementing these changes within their respective projects.

While not required, teams may optionally seek review from the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for exceptions that are particularly complex, or when additional feedback and guidance would be beneficial.

The primary objective of this document is to maintain transparency by tracking approved exceptions, helping contributors understand the governance rules applicable to the projects they engage with.
