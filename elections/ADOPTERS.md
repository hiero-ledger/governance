# Adopters

Adopters of the Hiero project are any organization that successfully leverages the Hiero project in the manner it was intended or repackages it as a core component of a service offering. If your organization is deploying an application or service on a Hiero-based network or hosting a Hiero-based network in your organization, please add your company name to this list. 

The Hiero TSCâ€™s intent in identifying adopters is to better understand the operational or production-level use of the Hiero project by its operators or users. We do this to ascertain the level of maturity the project has reached, its interactions with adopters, and its likelihood to continue growing within and supporting the ecosystem. Original sponsoring organizations, if any, may be included in the ADOPTERS.md file. 

In addition, the organizations listed within this document will be used to identify the list of organizations' approved electors capable of casting a vote for candidates for the End User Seat on the Hiero TSC.

Each entry in this file must contain:
- The name of the project or business
- The public Hiero ledger with an account for the elector (e.g. Hedera)
- The account of the elector
- A link to the website for the project or business
- A statement describing the role of this project or business within the Hiero ecosystem

It is a violation of the rules of the election for any one elector to vote more than once in an Adopters Seat election.
