# Nomination for Hiero TSC Maintainer seat

### Candidate

Georgi Lazarov - [Georgi-l95](https://github.com/georgi-l95)

### Qualifications

- **Full-Stack Core Infrastructure Contribution:** Georgi has been a key technical contributor across the entire Hiero network stack. His work spans foundational components including the `Consensus Node`, `Mirror Node`, and `Block-Node`. His involvement with developer tools like the `hiero-local-node` demonstrates a holistic understanding of how these critical systems interact to form a cohesive, functional network.
- **Critical Feature Implementation (EVM Compatibility):** Georgi was a significant contributor to the `hiero-json-rpc-relay`. This component is the critical bridge that enables EVM compatibility, allowing the vast ecosystem of Ethereum-based tools, dApps, and developers to interact with and build on Hiero. His technical execution on this front has been vital for ecosystem growth.
- **Empowering the Developer Experience:** Beyond the core protocol, Georgi has contributed to essential developer tooling, including the `hiero-sdk-go` and `Solo`. This shows an empathy for the developer journey and a commitment to reducing friction for builders in the ecosystem.
- **Proactive Initiative for Network Diversification:** In his personal time, Georgi created Hederium, a full implementation of the Hedera JSON-RPC Relay written in Golang. This self-started project demonstrates a profound commitment to the health of the ecosystem by proactively addressing the need for client diversity—a critical factor for network resilience and decentralization.
- **Commitment to Open Source Governance:** As an author and participant of the working group of several Hiero Improvement Proposals (HIPs), Georgi has shown he is invested not just in writing code, but in the collaborative governance process that steers the protocol's future.

### Why I’m backing him

Every successful L1 needs a vibrant application layer, but that layer can only exist on a rock-solid and comprehensive technical foundation. Georgi represents the crucial, hands-on engineering talent that builds and maintains that foundation across its entire breadth. His work is not siloed; it connects the deepest parts of the network—from the Consensus and Mirror Nodes to the forward-looking Block Node—with the external-facing components like the JSON RPC Relay that drive adoption.Giving Georgi a seat on the TSC ensures that the perspective of the full-stack protocol developer—the builder who understands the system-wide implications of any change—is strongly represented. He has a proven track record of strengthening the network from multiple angles simultaneously: enhancing stability with testing, driving growth with EVM compatibility, and improving the developer experience with better tooling. He will bring a practical, results-oriented, and technically-grou
