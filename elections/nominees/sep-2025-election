A nominee must fullfill the following requirements (as defined in the [TSC Charter](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/governance/blob/main/hiero-technical-charter.md)):

> - TSC Members are expected to cover deep technical domains including consensus technologies,
>   technical operations, tokenization, smart contracts, ecosystem applications such as wallets, exchanges, etc. (3.viii. in charter)
> - Nominees for the TSC shall (2.ix.b. in charter):
>  - Commit that they have the available bandwidth to make the time to invest in the TSC,
>  - Demonstrate an advanced level of professional experience as engineers in the scope of the Project, and
>  - Operate neutrally in discussions and put the goals and success of the Project in balance with any particular sub-project governed by the TSC.

A PR that contains a new nomination file must be approved by the nominee before it can be merged.
The nominee must review the nomination file and ensure that all information is correct, including the github username.
Once the nominee has reviewed the file, they should comment on the PR with "I approve this nomination" to indicate their approval.

Any PR that fullfills the requirements before the end of the 9th September 2025 (UTC) will be considered for the election.
