# Nomination

### Candidate Position  
Gaurang Torvekar - End User seat

### Qualifications  
Gaurang Torvekar has built his career at the intersection of blockchain development and hands-on product leadership. As **co-founder and CTO of Bonzo Finance**, he guided the protocol from early design discussions through to production, where it now secures over 37% of all Total Value Locked (TVL) in Hedera DeFi ($37 million), processes hundreds of transactions daily, and serves thousands of active users across more than 20 countries. Under his leadership, Bonzo implemented the innovative HCS-20 for the transparent auditability of points awarded to suppliers and borrowers, and leveraged HTS for tokenized assets, creating one of the network's most efficient DeFi protocols with very low transaction costs.

His deep experience with Hedera native services (HCS, HTS, smart contracts) complements his extensive work in the Ethereum and Polygon ecosystems. This cross-chain perspective uniquely positions him to address interoperability challenges facing the Hedera ecosystem. He is currently spearheading Bonzo's integration with LayerZero OFT and Axelar, which will enhance cross-chain liquidity on Hedera and potentially drive millions of dollars in liquidity to the Hedera network.

Before Bonzo, Gaurang was the principal developer of the Bastion SDKâ€”an ERC-4337 account abstraction toolkit that simplifies smart wallet integration. He also co-authored the ERC-5606 standard, which enables the creation of *Multiverse NFTs*, allowing for asset portability across web3 games and metaverses. His open-source contributions reflect a commitment to developing infrastructure that benefits the entire blockchain community.

He pairs deep technical expertise in Solidity, JavaScript, and smart contract architecture with proven product management skills, having led agile teams across distributed global environments. As an active community builder, he has organized over 15 Ethereum meetups in London and Singapore, mentored more than 30 emerging blockchain engineers through hackathons such as ConvAI and others, and created multiple explanatory videos on complex technical topics related to Hedera.

### Statement  
I would be honoured to serve on the Hiero Technical Steering Committee as the End User representative. Having guided Bonzo Finance from concept to one of the top-three DeFi protocols on Hedera, I have a deep understanding of the technical challenges and opportunities that decentralized application builders face daily on this network.

My commitment to collaborative governance stems from firsthand experience with the technical constraints that limit adoption. By representing the perspective of active builders, I will help ensure Hedera's technical roadmap aligns with real-world application needs. The committee will benefit from my unique combination of deep protocol engineering knowledge and practical experience scaling user-facing applications in production environments.
