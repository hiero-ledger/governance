### Qualifications
#### ioBuilders
Founded in 2018, ioBuilders is a technology firm specializing in Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), with a focus on Digital Assets, NFTs, DeepTech, R&D, and LegalTech. As a Software Integrator Partner of Hedera since 2021, ioBuilders has actively collaborated with Hedera Hashgraph and the HBAR Foundation to accelerate the adoption of Hedera-based solutions across industries.

Among our contributions are **two live asset tokenization platforms** — Openbrick, where we are co-founders, and RedSwan's platform, to whom we have been a key technology partner — which exemplify our commitment to **building impactful, real-world applications**.

Beyond product deployment, ioBuilders **leads the development of several flagship open-source initiatives** that are expanding the Hedera ecosystem by enabling faster go-to-market for enterprise solutions:

1. **Asset Tokenization Studio**:A toolkit for tokenizing digital securities, which has significantly increased awareness of Hedera’s asset tokenization capabilities and was recently recognized as a [Top Financial Innovation](https://x.com/hedera/status/1910347561593954659).
2. **Stablecoin Studio**: A suite of tools for configuring and managing stablecoins on Hedera, integrating HTS and HSCS to deliver high performance, flexibility, and cost-efficiency.
3. **Hedera Custodians Library**: An SDK that simplifies integration with custodial wallet providers, streamlining development processes for applications using secure wallet infrastructure.

In addition to technical contributions, ioBuilders actively promotes the Hedera ecosystem through **articles, blog posts, and public speaking engagements** at key industry events such as HederaCon, Token2049, and Merge Madrid.

ioBuilders brings **a unique dual perspective** that could be particularly valuable to the Hiero community:

1. **As end-users, through our co-founding role in Openbrick**, we offer first-hand insight into the challenges, needs, and opportunities of leveraging Hiero in real-world business cases.
2. **As a technology firm**, we design and implement enterprise solutions on Hedera for a wide range of clients, providing us with visibility into developer experience, tooling gaps, integration pain points, and broader DLT trends.

This holistic view positions us to **contribute informed, strategic input to guide the development of the Hiero ecosystem**.
