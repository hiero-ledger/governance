## Candidate/Elected Position

Milan Wiercx van Rhijn - End User Seat

## Qualification

Milan is a dedicated Hedera enthusiast passionate about innovation and growing the Hedera ecosystem. He excels at transforming abstract ideas into tangible products while actively supporting others to succeed within the ecosystem. As a leader of the HBAR Foundry, a decentralized collective of leading Hedera grassroots developers and builders, Milan has been facilitating Town Halls, outreach initiatives (such as participating as a panelist during the Hiero launch in Vienna), and coordinates the weekly Friday meetings. 

His accomplishments and recognitions within the community include winning multiple Hedera Hackathons: in 2023 with "Teppo", a proof-of-location system utilizing secure 424 NFC DNA tags for claiming location-based NFTs; in 2024 with "Nomid", a peer-to-peer physical payment system enabling tap-and-pay transactions with USDC; and most recently, the Hedera Hackathon 2.0 with Healthtoken.Ai, a tokenization engine for healthcare data. 

In addition to these projects, Milan actively contributes through various side initiatives, including no-code Hedera integrations (e.g. Zapier plugin, n8n.io), a transactions-per-second (TPS) notification system via Telegram, early Hedera AI telegram agents, and a honey traceability system (Honeytrail). He has worked with - and continues to work with - well-known companies and projects within the Hedera ecosystem, including Acoer, GoMint and Earthlings.land. 

An active member and respected member of the Hedera community, Milan strongly values integrity, fairness and unbiased support for all Hedera builders - qualities he believes align closely with the responsibilities of Hiero TSC member.

## Statement

Joining the Hiero TSC as an end-user representative is a natural extension of my ongoing efforts within the Hedera ecosystem over the past four years. My enthusiasm for Hedera and the open-source Hiero project remains unwavering. The intrinsic motivation I've had since the beginning - to support and empower developers and builders - is fundamental to my continued commitment. It is this empowerment that will ultimately enable Hedera's technology to reach its full potential and become integral global infrastructure. 

I firmly believe that unbiased representation and collaboration are essential for collective success. The extensive work and interactions I've had within the community have provided me with a deep understanding of user needs and positions me effectively to represent end users on the TSC. I am confident that my background, experience, and ongoing commitment to the community will allow me to serve effectively in this role.
