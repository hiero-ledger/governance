**Candidate**
May Chan

**Qualifications**
May has been a member of the Hedera ecosystem since 2021. She is the CEO and Co-Founder of HashPack, which was founded in May 2020 and launched in the Hedera Ecosystem in October 2020. Since its founding, HashPack has been a leader in the Hedera ecosystem. HashPack built the first signing library on the network (HashConnect), which catalyzed the entire retail defi ecosystem. Since then HashPack has worked closely with Hedera and the community, leading ecosystem initiatives such as smart contract support, native staking and many others. As of May 2025, HashPack's user base represents 95% of the Hedera retail ecosystem

On an individual level, May has been deeply involved in all levels of the community. May is a well-recognized spokesperson in the Hedera community, and has shared her story and insights at many Hedera events and in numerous interviews, podcasts and spaces. May was present at HederaCon 2025 in Denver, where she spoke on two panels on the main stage, in addition to her company's sponsorship of a booth.

May wrote and led the adoption of HIP-412, which sets the metadata schema for every NFT in the Hedera ecosystem, and has contributed on numerous HIPs (Hedera improvement proposals) over the past four years. More recently she has been an active contributor in the DeRec Alliance and is writing the Typescript implementation library with the help of Richard Goodhue and the rest of the alliance contributors.

As a TSC member, May would leverage her extensive network of users, developers, and companies across the Hedera ecosystem to ensure the technical direction of Hiero remains aligned with real-world implementation needs. Her unique perspective as CEO of HashPack provides direct insight into user experience challenges and opportunities, which would inform technical decisions with practical feedback loops. May's demonstrated commitment to open standards through her work on HIP-412 and the DeRec Alliance reflects her collaborative approach to ecosystem developmentâ€”an approach she would bring to the Technical Steering Committee to help Hiero achieve wider adoption and continued technical excellence.

**Statement**

I would be honored to serve on the Technical Steering Committee for Hiero. Having witnessed and contributed to Hedera's growth since 2021, I am deeply committed to its continued technical excellence and adoption. My experience building essential infrastructure for the ecosystem has given me valuable perspective on both the technical challenges and practical needs of Hedera's diverse stakeholders. If selected, I would bring my collaborative approach, technical insights, and community connections to help guide Hiero's development in a way that serves developers, users, and the broader ecosystem. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Hedera's technical governance and help shape its future direction.
