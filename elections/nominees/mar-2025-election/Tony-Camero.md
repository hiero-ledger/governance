# Nomination

### Candidate

[Tony Camero for End User Seat] (https://github.com/tonycamero)

### Qualifications

Tony has been a builder and ecosystem strategist within Hedera since 2018. He is the founder of Scend Technologies, the company behind CraftTrust — a real-world deployment of decentralized payments, rewards, and stablecoin settlement serving the regulated cannabis sector. Tony has led deep integrations with Hedera-native partners such as Brale and EarthID to bring KYB/KYC, identity, and regulated stablecoins to non-custodial wallets and small business banking solutions.

Tony also leads the development of the **Scend Trust Ecosystem**, a decentralized framework designed to return control of identity, assets, and communication to individuals. Through tools like the Scend App and The Culture Wallet, Tony is focused on building usable, compliant Web3 infrastructure that empowers communities to drive local economies and onboard into digital finance on their terms.

### Statement

I would be honored to serve on the TSC. I believe my experience building real-world, production-grade applications on Hedera, combined with my commitment to user-first and compliance-forward design, would allow me to make a valuable contribution. I am passionate about public-good infrastructure, and I view Hiero as a foundational layer for the next wave of adoption. My goal is to ensure the ecosystem remains open, inclusive, and technically excellent — and that it serves both the builders and the communities they empower.
