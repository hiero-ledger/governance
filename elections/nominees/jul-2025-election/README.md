> - TSC Members are expected to cover deep technical domains including consensus technologies,
>   technical operations, tokenization, smart contracts, ecosystem applications such as wallets, exchanges, etc. (3.viii. in charter)
> - Nominees for the TSC shall (2.ix.b. in charter):

A PR that contains a new nomination file must be approved by the nominee before it can be merged.
The nominee must review the nomination file and ensure that all information is correct, including the github username.
Once the nominee has reviewed the file, they should comment on the PR with "I approve this nomination" to indicate their approval.

Any PR that fullfills the requirements before the end of the 8th July 2025 (UTC) will be considered for the election.
