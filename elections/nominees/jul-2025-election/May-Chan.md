# Nomination for May Chan

## Candidate  
[May Chan](https://github.com/may-hashpack)

## Qualifications

**Proven ecosystem driver.** HashPack users have opened **500,000 + Hedera accounts and represent roughly 90–95 % of the network’s monthly active users**. HashPack's proven track record has enabled best-in-class UX for leading companies on Hedera and stability that is required for non-custodial wallets.

**Standards leadership.** May wrote and seeded adoption for HIP-412, the defacto standard for NFT Metadata on Hedera and regularly participates in other HIPs like HIP-1009. Additionally, she has recently created new voting standards (HCS-8 / HCS-9) which are utilized in hashgraph.vote for community-led initiatives and governance. 

**Product execution at scale.** Under her direction the team delivered first-to-market wallet features on Hedera—one-click account creation, peer-to-peer *Secure Trade* within the NFT gallery, Ledger hardware support, *PACK* staking, and the open-source **HashConnect** signing library that bootstrapped the dApp ecosystem. As part of the work in the DeRec Alliance, May is is writing the Typescript implementation library with the help of Richard Goodhue and the rest of the alliance contributors.

**Community-first approach.** May is a fixture in Discord support channels and X Spaces, translating user feedback directly into roadmap items. She represents HashPack in the Hashgraph Online DAO, participates in DeRec Alliance working sessions, and speaks regularly at Hedera events such as **HederaCon 2025**. 

**Operational track record.** Since launching in October 2020, HashPack has shipped on schedule through every major network upgrade, including smart-contract support, native staking, and HIP-412 NFT integration.

## Why I’m backing her

May already bridges users, developers, and community leaders every day. Giving her a TSC seat simply formalizes work she is doing by default and ensures wallet, dApp, and standards decisions stay grounded in the realities of the community that moves real volume on Hedera. Her incredible experience as a leader would help drive additional practical and results-oriented technical leadership to the Hiero Steering Committee.
