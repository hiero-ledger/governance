# Community to Hiero Repository Transfer Process

When transferring ownership of a repository from a community-owned organization to [Hiero-Ledger][hiero] in Github the steps outlined below must be completed.

## Definitions

- **Repository Transfer Agent (TA)**
    - The person responsible for transferring the repository
    - Must have ability to create a repository on the receiving organizations side (Hiero)
- **Repository Transfer Approval Agent (AA)**
    - The person responsible for approving PRs throughout the transfer process
    - Must have approval authority on the [Hiero-Ledger/governance][governance] repository and on the target repository

## PRE-TRANSFER Checks

- Ensure all runners (`ubuntu-latest`) have a self-hosted runner label created. This is necessary for security 
  purposes. Contact the [@hiero/platform-ci team][hiero-platform-ci] for assistance.

## Day-Before Checks

The day before a repository is transferred the TA and AA shall verify the following checks have been complete

- DCO Audit is complete
- License Audit is complete
- Pre-Transfer Checks are complete
  - TA has the following:
    - New repository Information
    - List of Maven Central packages
    - List of Gradle Plugin Central packages
    - List of NPMJS packages
    - Awareness of Codecov needs
    - List of repository variables/states
    - List of repository secrets
    - Repository Point of Contact for day-of questions

## Transfer Day

Throughout the transfer process both TA and AA shall be available.

The following steps shall occur to transfer a repository into Hiero from a source organization

- The TA will open a new ticket in the [Governance][governance] repository
  - The TA will create a new branch on the [Governance][governance] repository's ticket
- The TA will modify the `config.yaml` file in this repository with the following information
  - The new maintainer group name (`REPO-maintainers`)
  - The new maintainers for the group
  - The new committer group name (`REPO-committers`)
  - The new set of committers for that group
  - The new repository to pull in
  - The `tsc` group should have the `maintain` role on the repository
  - The `github-maintainers` group should have the `admin` role on the repository
  - The `github-committers` group should have the `write` role on the repository
  - The `REPO-maintainers` group should have the `maintain` role on the repository
  - The `REPO-committers` group should have the `write` role on the repository
  - The visibility field should be set to `public`
- The TA will generate a pull request in the [Governance][governance]repository
- The AA will approve the changes in [Governance][governance]
- The TA needs to delete the empty repository generated by `clowarden` created by the previous steps
- The TA will transfer the repository from the source organization into Hiero
  - The TA will assign the `Target Repository Name` to the repo upon transfer
- The TA will assign the `Target Repository` to the appropriate github self-hosted runner group
- The TA will open a PR on the `Target Repository`
  - The TA will modify the self-hosted runner labels in the github actions
    - Note: This will enable the repository actions to run after transfer
- The AA will approve the PR on the `Target Repository`
- The TA will add the repo to the Hiero-Ledger organization global rule
- The TA will set the "Social preview" in the repository settings to the
  [Hiero-Ledger Social Media Template](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/.github/blob/main/resources/social-media-template.png)
- If publishing to NPMJS
  - The TA has created the new NPM_TOKEN for the new repository
  - The TA has added the NPM_TOKEN to the repository secrets
- If publishing to gradle plugin central
  - The TA has added the GRADLE_CACHE_USERNAME secret to the repository
  - The TA has added the GRADLE_CACHE_PASSWORD secret to the repository
- If publishing to Maven Central
  - The maven central namespace tokens are created on the [Hiero-Ledger][hiero] MC namespace
  - The TA has added the OSSRH_USERNAME secret to the repository
  - The TA has added the OSSRH_PASSWORD secret to the repository
- If performing semantic release
  - The TA has created the NPMJS token for the repository
  - The TA has added the NPM_TOKEN secret to the repository
- The TA has verified the appropriate secrets needed by the workflows are defined in the github repository
- The TA has verified that appropriate variables have been defined in the new repository
- The TA has updated the CODEOWNERS file to include the teams defined on the [Hiero-Ledger][hiero] repository
- The TA will update the [transition.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/transition.md) document to show the transition is complete.

At this point the repository is considered **transferred**.

## Post-Transfer Activities

- After the repository is transferred the maintainers and committers shall ensure the repository behaves
  as expected and will triage and solve any immediate issues
- After the repository is transferred the maintainers and committers shall ensure all applicable websites are up to date.
- After the repository is transferred the [@hashgraph/platform-ci team][platform-ci] will deprecate existing packages
