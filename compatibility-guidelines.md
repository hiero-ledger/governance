# Introduction

An independent third party researched how other leading blockchain networks
manage breaking changes and backwards compatibility.

The independent 3rd party concluded the following:

* None of the leading blockchain networks have a definitive public policy with
  respect to breaking changes and backwards compatibility.   
* None have stated that breaking changes cannot happen. All networks
  communicate an intent to prioritize backwards compatibility and propose that
  major changes and deprecations will be communicated clearly and in advance.

In summary, all examined networks:

* Strive to balance technological advancement with maintaining stability and
  minimizing disruption to existing applications and services.  
* Employ various communication channels, including release notes, blog posts,
  and developer forums, to inform stakeholders of changes.  
* Utilize governance mechanisms involving validators and/or token holders to
  approve major protocol changes.
* Provide migration guides and support during significant updates or SDK
  deprecations to facilitate smooth transitions for developers.

Hiero intends to follow the same principles.

# Backwards compatibility and breaking changes

The development of software involves ongoing agility and the need to adapt to
changing technologies and evolving user demands. The adoption of new features
and improved capabilities often leads to critical decisions including how to
maximize the opportunities offered by these changes against potential user
impact. 

As much as is possible, Hiero projects are committed to maintaining backwards
compatibility to ensure a reliable experience for users and developers. Below
is an outline of the approach towards backwards compatibility, the process for
introducing breaking changes when necessary, and the communication and
deprecation timelines required to maintain transparency and stability within
the Hiero ecosystem.

Hiero encompasses a large number of projects at different stages of
development, the principles outlined below may not immediately apply to every
Hiero project, but will apply to the following projects. Other Hiero projects
may choose how to handle backwards compatibility as their maturity increases.

* Hiero Consensus Node  
* Hiero Block Node  
* Hiero JSON RPC Relay  
* Hiero Mirror Node  
* Hiero SDKs (Go, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Java, CPP, Swift)

## Ensuring Backwards Compatibility

* All changes must be evaluated for their impact on existing users and
  applications.  
* Deprecation of features must be accompanied by clear documentation and
  migration paths.  
* Consider every public API as potentially accessible to any community member.  
* Feature enhancements and bug fixes other than those that address critical
  defects or security vulnerabilities should be implemented in a way that does
  not break existing functionality. For example and not limited to:  
  * Adding new methods when a return type must be changed  
  * Adding parameters to methods with default values is acceptable if behaviour
    isn’t changed when parameters aren’t supplied  
* APIs and data structures should follow versioning best practices to avoid
  disruption, for example:  
  * Changes to return data structures should be additive, not subtractive  
  * New API parameters should be defaulted without changes to behaviour if not
    provided

## Breaking Changes Process

The process below will be followed when a breaking change is planned, except in
exceptional circumstances such as issues affecting the security of the network.

Security is the number one concern for public ledgers, a critical security fix
necessitating a breaking change may result in compressed or immediate
deprecation timelines and may require more restrictive communications of the
issue and related remediation in order to avoid exploitation of the security
concern prior to the deployment of the fix.

### Proposal and Review

* A detailed proposal outlining the breaking change must be submitted for
  review by internal stakeholders and technical leads.  
* The proposal must include justification, potential impact, short and medium
  term workarounds, and alternatives considered.  
* Open source maintainer stakeholders and technical leads must review, provide
  feedback and approve.

### Hiero Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Approval

* A formal meeting with the Hiero Technical Steering Committee (TSC) must be
  scheduled.  
* The TSC will review the proposed breaking change and assess its necessity and
  impact.  
* Approval from the TSC is required before proceeding with the implementation.

### Deprecation and Communication Plan

* A structured deprecation plan must be established, adhering to best
  practices.  
* The deprecation timeline should provide users with adequate time to migrate.  
* Clear documentation, including migration guides and upgrade instructions,
  must be published.  
* Communication should include:  
  * Announcements in official Hiero community channels.  
  * Updates in release notes.  
  * Notifications in relevant technical documentation.

### Implementation and Monitoring

* The breaking change should be implemented with feature flags, if possible, to
  allow gradual adoption.  
* While making the decisions, the TSC should look at adoption rates and
  identify potential issues, if applicable to the project.  
* Feedback from the community should be actively collected and addressed.

### SDKs

Hiero SDKs will adhere to Semantic Versioning
([https://semver.org](https://semver.org/)) whereby an SDK version is
identified as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

* MAJOR version when an incompatible API change is made, subject to deprecation
 timelines.  
* MINOR version functionality is added in a backward compatible manner.  
* PATCH version for backward compatible bug fixes.


Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Upgrades to a MINOR or PATCH version should be seamless for application
developers.

Upgrades to a MAJOR version may entail some rework by application developers.

In the event of a MAJOR version update of the SDKs

* The previous version will benefit from functionality enhancements for a
  minimum period of 6 months.  
* The previous version will be maintained for major bugs and critical security
  fixes for a minimum period of 1 year.

### Deprecation Timelines 

* **Initial Announcement:** At least 3 months before enforcement, announce the
  deprecation and provide migration guidelines.  
* **Active Support:** Continue supporting the deprecated feature for at least 6
  months while encouraging migration. A longer period may be considered
  depending on the severity of the deprecation.  
* **Final Removal:** The feature is removed only after the communicated
  timeline has elapsed and sufficient migration support has been provided.

### Exceptions

#### EVM 

Hiero inherits its EVM from the Ethereum community. Should a breaking change be
included in a particular release of the EVM, this breaking change will most
likely carry over to Hiero.

#### Emergency/Security issues

If a defect is found on the network that puts either the network or the users'
security at risk, then in that unlikely scenario, Hedera will upgrade the
network with the fix as soon as practical. These scenarios are expected to be
very rare.

#### Other

Hiero depends on 3rd party dependencies (e.g. post quantum cryptography). It is
not possible to foresee whether changes imposed on Hiero by 3rd parties would
affect backwards compatibility.
